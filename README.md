# 🎨 Fast Neural Style Transfer (PyTorch)

A **Fast Neural Style Transfer** implementation in **PyTorch** that generates stylized images in **real time** using a feed-forward neural network trained with **perceptual loss**.

Inspired by *Johnson et al., 2016*, this approach trains a single network per style to perform instant stylization, unlike optimization-based neural style transfer methods.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The style transfer network is a feed-forward **Transformer Network** composed of convolutional, residual, and upsampling layers.

### Architecture Overview

- Initial convolution layers with **Reflection Padding**
- Downsampling using strided convolutions
- **5 Residual Blocks** for feature transformation
- Upsampling via nearest-neighbor interpolation + convolution
- **Instance Normalization** for improved stylization quality

## 🧠 Perceptual Loss

Training is guided by **perceptual loss**, computed in feature space using a pretrained **VGG-16** network.

- **Content Loss**  
  Mean Squared Error between content and generated image features  

- **Style Loss**  
  Mean Squared Error between Gram matrices of style and generated image features  

This allows the model to preserve content structure while applying rich artistic styles.
