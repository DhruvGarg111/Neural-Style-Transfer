# 🎨 Fast Neural Style Transfer (PyTorch)

A **Fast Neural Style Transfer** implementation in **PyTorch** that generates stylized images in **real time** using a feed-forward neural network trained with **perceptual loss**.

This project is based on the idea introduced by *Johnson et al., 2016*, where a single neural network is trained per style to perform instant image stylization, unlike optimization-based Neural Style Transfer methods.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The model consists of:

* Initial convolution layers with **Reflection Padding**
* Downsampling using strided convolutions
* **5 Residual Blocks** for feature transformation
* Upsampling via nearest-neighbor interpolation + convolution
* **Instance Normalization** to stabilize and enhance stylization

The perceptual loss network uses a **pretrained VGG-16**, extracting features from:

* `relu1_2`
* `relu2_2`
* `relu3_3`
* `relu4_3`

## 🧪 Loss Functions

* **Content Loss**: Mean Squared Error between content and generated image features
* **Style Loss**: Mean Squared Error between Gram matrices of style and generated image features

Both losses are computed in **feature space**, not pixel space.
